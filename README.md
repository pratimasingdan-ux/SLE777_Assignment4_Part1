# SLE777 Assignment 4 - Part 1

This repository contains my R Markdown analysis and report for Part 1 of SLE777 Assignment 4.  
It includes all code and answers for Questions 1–10, covering data import, wrangling, visualisation, and basic statistical analysis.

## Files
- `assessment 4.Rmd` – the main R Markdown script with all code and comments  
- `assessment4.pdf` – the knitted report generated from the R Markdown  
- `gene_expression.tsv` – RNA-seq count data (input file)  
- `growth_data.csv` – tree growth data (input file)

## How to run
1. Download the `.Rmd` file and open it in RStudio.  
2. Make sure the data files are in the same directory.  
3. Knit the `.Rmd` to produce the PDF or HTML report.  

This code reads, analyses, and visualises biological data, and performs a t-test to compare tree growth at two sites.
